Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that is usually played between two people. One person thinks of a word and the other person tries to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. If the guesser suggests a letter that is in the word, the other person reveals all instances of that letter in the word. If the guesser suggests a letter that is not in the word, the other person draws a part of a "hangman" figure (traditionally, a gallows and a stick figure) to represent a wrong guess.

The goal of the game is for the guesser to correctly guess the word before the hangman figure is completely drawn. The number of incorrect guesses allowed before the hangman figure is completed can vary, but traditionally it is six. If the hangman figure is completed before the word is guessed, the other person wins.

In modern versions of the game, the hangman figure is often replaced with a simple scorekeeping system, such as a number or a series of dashes to represent the number of incorrect guesses made. Additionally, the game can be played solo with a computer generating a word for the player to guess. Hangman is a fun and challenging game that can help improve spelling and vocabulary skills.
